# ExoNet: Idea Illustration & Feasiblity 

## Overview

This simple multi-agent framework in `chat_multi.py` offers collaborative AI agents with their own specialized backgrounds/expertise and flexible interaction order!


## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Individual Agent Backgrounds**
- **Specialty Definitions**: Clear role and expertise areas for each agent
- **Model Configuration**: Individual model settings per agent
- **PDFs**: Each agent can have access to specific PDF documents
- **Images**: Visual context through image files
- **Websites**: Web content as background knowledge
- **Text Files**: Additional text-based context


### ðŸ”„ **Flexible Interaction Patterns**
- **Custom Interaction Order**: Define how agents collaborate, e.g., [1, 3, 2, 4]
- **Multiple Rounds**: Configurable deliberation cycles. Each round contains the entire list of interaction order. For example, two rounds would be [1, 3, 2, 4] and [1, 3, 2, 4]
- **Collaborative Learning**: Agents build upon each other's responses
- **Human interaction**: After running default_question for the specified number of rounds, user can prompt new questions. 



## Usage

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Basic usage with config file
python chat_multi.py --config config_example.json

# Enable verbose output
python chat_multi.py --config config_example.json --verbose

```

### Suggestions
- **Azure OpenAI**: The implementation employs direct calls via Azure OpenAI: API key, base, deployment name should be specified accordingly. See line 370 in `chat_multi.py` and specialize in `~/.bashrc` e.g. export AZURE_API_KEY=XXX
- **max_tokens**: Higher max_tokens (6000-8000) for detailed analysis, while lower max_tokens for concise responses. However note that if too constrained, model may have trouble outputting reasonable response. 
- **char_limit** For background information, web crawling, char_limit (e.g. 2000) should be chosen depending on the number of documents and the context window.
- **clean_slate**: Starting fresh in every round allows for convenient repetition of the question across multiple rounds, acquiring statistical information to account for the model stochasticity.
